# =============================================================================
#  PHISHING GUARD — YARA Rules: Phishing & Credential Harvesting Indicators
# =============================================================================
#
#  HOW YARA RULES WORK
#  ═══════════════════
#  A YARA rule has three sections:
#
#  meta:     Descriptive metadata — author, description, severity, etc.
#            These are just comments stored with the rule; they do NOT affect matching.
#
#  strings:  Patterns to search for inside a file's raw bytes.
#            Three types:
#              - Text strings:  $s = "some text"  nocase ascii wide
#              - Hex patterns:  $h = { 4D 5A 90 00 }  (byte sequence)
#              - Regex:         $r = /pattern/  (PCRE-like)
#
#  condition: Boolean logic combining the string matches.
#             Examples:
#               any of them          -> any ONE defined string matched
#               all of them          -> ALL strings must match
#               2 of ($s*)           -> at least 2 strings starting with $s
#               $a and not $b        -> $a found, $b not found
#               #s1 > 5              -> string $s1 appears more than 5 times
#               @s1 < 1024           -> $s1 found within first 1 KB
#               filesize < 500KB     -> match only small files
#
